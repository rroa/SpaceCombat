* Just created the Game class. Doing some formatting and implementation of the main methods that comprise it.
* Got to admit, I'm not happy to be using SDL 1.2, the API feels old while using it and getting official documentation is hard.
* Finally found the official docs: http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/sdlsetvideomode.html. Google kept taking me to the SDL 2.0 wiki.
